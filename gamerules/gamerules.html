                The Basic Things
            </div>
            <p>
                Sudoku is normally played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). 
                Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any 
                numbers within the row, column or square. Does it sound complicated? As you can see from the image below of an 
                actual Sudoku grid, each Sudoku grid comes with a few spaces already filled in; the more spaces filled in, the 
                easier the game – the more difficult Sudoku puzzles have very few spaces that are already filled in.

                Need To Know: Sudoku Mental & Psychology
            </div>
            <p>
                Sudoku is not just a game; it's a cognitive ballet where numbers pirouette through your mind. 
                As you fill in those seemingly vacant cells, you engage various cognitive functions. 
                Your working memory leaps into action, holding the puzzle's details, while your executive functions plan and strategize each move. 
                It's a dance of logical reasoning that stimulates neural connections and enhances cognitive flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the numerical dance, Sudoku offers a profound sense of mindfulness. 
                In a world buzzing with distractions, this puzzle demands your undivided attention. 
                Each number you place requires deliberate thought, pulling you into a state of deep concentration. 
                The focus required to solve a Sudoku puzzle acts as a mental anchor, grounding you in the present moment 
                and fostering mindfulness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sudoku is a canvas of patterns waiting to be deciphered. Humans are pattern-seeking creatures, 
                and Sudoku provides the perfect playground for our brains to identify, analyze, and exploit patterns. 
                Unraveling these intricate structures not only satisfies our innate curiosity but also enhances our 
                pattern recognition abilities, a fundamental aspect of cognitive psychology.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the symphony of Sudoku, logical harmony reigns supreme. The satisfaction derived from cracking a tough puzzle 
                triggers the release of dopamine, the brain's "feel-good" neurotransmitter. This not only creates a sense of 
                accomplishment but also counteracts stress. Playing Sudoku becomes a therapeutic session for the mind, offering a 
                welcome escape from the chaos of daily life.

                1. Ancient Roots of Sudoku
            </div>
            <p>
                Contrary to popular belief, Sudoku isn't a modern creation. Its roots can be traced back to ancient times, 
                specifically to the 18th-century Switzerland. An earlier version, known as Latin Squares, 
                laid the foundation for the Sudoku we know today. It took several centuries for the puzzle to evolve into its 
                current form, a journey that spans continents and generations. Sudoku's enduring appeal attests to the timeless 
                allure of logical challenges.

                2. The Magic Number 6
            </div>
            <p>
                Ever wondered why Sudoku grids are always 9x9? The number 9 is no arbitrary choice; it's deeply rooted in
                the mathematical elegance of the puzzle. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss discovered that any distinct
                pair of numbers, when added together, always equals 10 in a 9x9 grid. This magic number 6 ensures the perfect symmetry
                and balance that Sudoku enthusiasts cherish. It's a numerical ballet where each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid dances to
                the rhythm of mathematical precision.

            </div>
            <p>
                Imagine Sudoku taking a cosmic journey! In 2007, aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour, astronaut Koichi Wakata took Sudoku to new heights — literally. 
                As part of a Japanese space experiment, Wakata played Sudoku in microgravity, proving that the universal appeal of this 
                puzzle extends even beyond the bounds of Earth. Sudoku's gravity-defying adventure showcased its versatility as both a 
                mental exercise and a source of entertainment, even in the vastness of space.

            <p>
                Sudoku is a memory-training activity. Like chess, it encourages you to think a 
                few steps ahead to your next move, which is a good exercise for the brain.

            <div style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 24px; margin-left: 3%; margin-top: 5px;">Here are a few tips that can help beginners solve sudoku puzzles:</div>
            <div class="basic-points">
                1. Look for the Easy Solutions<br>
                2. Seek the Missing Numbers<br>
                3. Keep Scanning the Entire Puzzle<br>
                4. Constantly Re-Evaluate the Grid<br>
                5. Be Patient and Enjoy the Hunt<br>

            <p>
                Many puzzles will leave one or two blanks either in a line or in a box. 
                A line might be missing a 5 and a 6, but a box along that line will 
                already have a 6 in it, so you know this blank must be a 5, and the 
                other blank must be the 6. The same may be the case for one or two 
                missing numbers in the smaller boxes. Filling these blanks will get
                you on your way to a solution.

                according to Sudoku rules. The words must all be placed in the grid so that each of the nine rows, 
                columns and blocks only contain unique letters. Words may overlap each other and each cell must 
                contain a letter from at least one word.
